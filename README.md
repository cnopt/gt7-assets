### Cars

Grouped into folders by manufacturer number. Inside each folder will have subfolders for specific cars. Not sure how the ID works yet. Inside this subfolder will be a bunch of `.img` files for transparent car thumbnails, and some `.jpg` files for the car when it's in the used car dealership.
